# What is react 
- First react is a library of javaScript.
- Basically React convert the html code into jsx. 
- In simple term React give the ability to run the html code inside the javaScript.

# Why we use React 
- React is a single page application. 
- Basically it give the ability to render the page without reloading the website. 
- Let's take some example like:- we have a home page and that content the about page link So when we going the about page while clicking So, it would be render in the same page without reloading. 
- React make our web smoother and very fast. 

# How react do our Web fast
- So, react use the virtual dom instead of actual dom, While when we perform the task in just single tag then actual dom render the whole html code so if our website is so big like a facebook it's run very slow, And while we do the same thing in the react it will render only the perticuller task. Thats why react provide the ability to run our web smoothly and fast.    

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
